## Introduction
=======

Hi, I'm a [human](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/U4wAAOSwyrBfUrXT/s-l400.jpg). I can breath air and perform basic tasks. 

Don't worry, I'm not an alien. 

There's nothing to worry about, aliens probably don't exist. right?..

Anyways, I have this cute [creatu--](https://yt3.ggpht.com/-7zFDHK5X45w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QJfHeLTEZwE/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg) I mean [dog](https://yt3.ggpht.com/-7zFDHK5X45w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QJfHeLTEZwE/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg). My dog is cute, however he is trying to intimidate me by expelling loud sound waves at a consistent interval..
I think [humans](https://cdn.sci-news.com/images/enlarge/image_2979e-Vitruvian-Man.jpg) call that phenomenon as "barking".

It's pretty amazing how the [human](https://cdn.sci-news.com/images/enlarge/image_2979e-Vitruvian-Man.jpg) society came up with [quantum mechanics](https://online.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/styles/figure_default/public/2018-09/quantum-mechanics-for-scientists-engineers_SOE-YEEQMSE01.jpg?itok=KKZKLf5_)! You guys just need one more step to control [time itself](https://www.calleadesign.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/2/thumbnail/1024x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/1/0/10-203-14.png)! :)
